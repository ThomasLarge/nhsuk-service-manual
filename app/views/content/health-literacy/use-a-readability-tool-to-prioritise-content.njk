  <p>It cannot tell you how easy your content is to understand. But it can show if the language might be too complex for many people.</p>

  <h2>Use a SMOG calculator</h2>
  <p>We use a tool called a SMOG (or SMOG Index) calculator to measure readability. SMOG works better than other tools for health information. It uses the number of sentences and complex words (3 or more syllables) to give a readability score.</p>
  <p> The <a href="https://www.webfx.com/tools/read-able/">readability test tool on WebFX</a>, for example, includes a SMOG calculator. Enter the url of the page you want to test and check the SMOG score.</p>

  <h2>Prioritise content with a score over 14</h2>
  <p>The lower the score, the fewer complex words you're using.</p>
  <p>A score higher than 14 means most users might struggle with the language in your content.</p>

  <h2>Do not rely on readability scores alone</h2>
  <p>A readability score under 14 does not prove your content is useful for your users. It just means you're not using lots of complex words.</p>
  <p>Readability scores do not tell you if your content is easy to understand or act on.</p>
  <p>You can only find out how well your content works by testing it with users.</p>

  <h2>Improve your content</h2>
  <p>When you've identified content with a high readability score, look to improve it using:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the <a href="/design-system/design-principles">NHS design principles</a></li>
    <li>our guidance about <a href="/content/how-we-write">how to write for NHS digital services</a></li>
